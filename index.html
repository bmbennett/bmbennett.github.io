			<h3>All about me</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Hello. Nice to meet you digitally.</p>

				<p>I am a freelance graphic designer and Creative Director of the US based company Luxe Beat Media. I design, build and manage their digital publication, Luxe Beat Magazine. Previous to this I was the Art Editor for the Sunday Express Magazine based in London.</p>

				<p>I am currently growing webbed limbs and have completed courses in UX Design, Programming and After Effects. I would love to hear from anyone who might offer work experience in UX and Programming.</p>

				<p>I am experienced in art directing, photoshoots, project managing and have worked with InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator for 15 years along with many other apps.</p>

				<p>I am also building a name for myself as a travel writer – working assignments across Europe and US. My passion for food landed me the opportunity to work with chef Katherine Frelon – designing and producing her first book, ‘Shop. Cook. Eat.’</P>

				<p>…Oh, and I also make beer!</p>

				<p>To find out a more detailed history of who, what and where I've been in the world, check out my LinkedIn profile</p>

				<p>If you think you might have some work up your sleeves get in touch:</p>

				<p>I am open to all creative ideas and projects.</p>
